Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:

It is a systematic way of designing, developing, testing, deploying and maintenance of software products following certain principles and methods to the development of the software application example of software applications are the operating systems.

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?

Software engineering differs from the traditional programming in that there are more advance tools and principles that make the development and deployment much effective, easier and cost efficient  example by the use of AI whereas in traditional programming was not easy to find help and execute programmes.

Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.

Requirements – This where one collects all the requirements needed for the development for reference to check quality and also document it.
Design- Software are designed in order to meet the consumer needs and shows an overview of the software product i.e. an effective user interface.
Implementation- The actual development stage that is writing codes and building the software according to the design and requirements.
Testing- Software applications are tested so as be able to check whether it meets the functional requirements and for improving some features in order to produce a quality product.
Deployment- This is a phase where the product is implanted and handed to the user.
Maintenance- It is an ongoing support and enhancement of the software after deployment.

Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?

Waterfall model is a systematic and linear procedure with detailed phases followed during software development whereas agile model is iterative and incremental procedure focused on flexibility, collaboration and responding to change.
The main difference is that waterfall follows a linear and sequential approach where one stage is completed before going to the next while agile is flexible  where tasks are completed in small sprints.
Waterfall model can be used in government projects example banking software systems where it requires high security and compliance to the security standards and legal requirements.
Agile model can be used in developing mobile apps as it is expected to evolve will require changes when developing.


Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.

Requirements Engineering- This is a process of collecting and documenting everything needed for the development of a successful software products, it focuses on identifying, documenting and managing the requirements of a system. 
It is important since it makes the application aligns with the user needs, reduces risks that may occur during the development and deployment of the system and improves quality.
Understand the user need,
Gather the need requirements from the stakeholders. 
Document on the procedure to be used and the information collected generally.
Analyze the information by prioritizing activities and document the specific requirements.
Validate that the requirements portrays the stakeholder’s needs and is feasible.

Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?

 Modularity is an aspect of dividing a software system into separate, interchangeable components, known as modules, each of which encapsulates a set of related functionalities. It enhances the maintainability, scalability, and flexibility of software systems. 
It improves maintainability in that an individual module can be modified, updated, or replaced without affecting the entire system.
Scalability in that individual modules can be easily developed and deployed independently hence can be scaled easily.

Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?

Testing is  crucial because it is used for quality assurance, enhancement before deployment by checking if it meets the consumer’ needs.
Unit testing- it is the testing that involves testing individual modules of the software.
Integration testing- testing interactions between different components.
System testing- testing the whole software system as one that is without differentiating components.
Acceptance testing this is testing done to ensure it meets the users’ needs.

Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.

Version control systems are tools that help manage changes to source code over time. 
It is used for tracking  changes to source code and coordinating  work among team members . 
Examples are  Git – Initialization “git init”, cloning ‘git clone’, Branching ‘git branch’, staging area, collaboration supports collaborations through GitHub.
Subversion- centralized system, version directories, commit and file locking.

Software Project Management:

giDiscuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?

  The role of a project manager is planning, guiding and coordinating software projects from initiation to a successful completion by effectively managing resources, risks and communication. A project manager is important since he/she oversees the whole projects.
Key responsibilities;
Planning and scheduling, define project scope, objectives, and deliverables. 
Resource and risk management, allocate resources and identify potential risks and uncertainty and develop risk mitigation.
Communication, ensures collorations between team members and coordination between team members and stakeholders.
Budget and cost management, monitor project expenses and resource utilization to ensure adherence to budgetary constraints.
Quality Assurance, ensures that the software meets the requirements and the stakeholder’s needs as agreed.
Challenges;
Managing changes to project scope without negatively impacting project.requirements may change during developing cycle which may cause cost and time constraints.
Managing projects with complex technical requirements, that requires specialized expertise and careful coordination.
Overcoming communication barriers and ensuring effective communication among project team members, stakeholders, and external partners.
Time and resource constraints where there is limited time and resources to be used, tight deadlines – pressures to meet short time period may lead poor quality software products.

Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?

Software maintenance is the process of modifying a software product after it has been deployed or is use to correct faults, improve performance and adapt it to a changed environment. 
Types of maintenance activities;
Corrective Maintenance, to fix bugs and defects found in the system.
Adaptive Maintenance, to modify the software so as to adapt it to a changed environment.
Preventive Maintenance, to modify software in order to prevent the software from security vulnerability and enhance reliability.
To enhance the system longevity, repair in case of damage, improve performance and aids fix security vulnerability.

Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?

Examples of ethical issues;
Privacy and data protection, handle sensitive personal data responsibly.
Respect intellectual property rights and avoid plagiarism. 
Ensure the security of the software and responsible handle discovered vulnerabilities.
How to ensure adherence to ethical standards;
Training on ethical courses to understand ethical principles.
Adherence to Professional Codes of Conduct.
Ensure compliance with Laws and Regulations.
Establish policies and protections to encourage employees to report unethical behavior or violations of ethical standards.
Establish ethical review boards or committees within organizations to review software projects and assess their ethical implications.
